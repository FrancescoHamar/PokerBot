# PokerBot (2020)

Discord Bot which lets two players play Texas Hold-em 1v1!

## Functioning:
After starting a game from a given lobby, the two players gain access to private chats with the bot (on the server), where they will see their own cards and communicate with the bot. The game will then progress through flop, river, and turn.

## Possible implementations:

The idea is possibly to tie server points into the game by implementing this one page script into larger Custom Discord Bot, as well as creating the proper environment.
This involves implementing 3 chats: a lobby and a private chat for each player.

Otherwise, the bot can simply be used by itself to play games without any stakes.

The file contains IDs for the chats found on the server that it was tested on. The run token was also removed (the one in the commit history is no longer in function).
